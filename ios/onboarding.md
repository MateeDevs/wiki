# Matee Wiki - iOS - Onboarding

## First week at Matee :tada:
- Welcome! Let's get you started! :rocket:
- Take a look at our [iOS repositories](/ios/repositories.md), clone [devstack-ios-app](https://github.com/MateeDevs/devstack-ios-app) and try to build it on your Mac.
- Study the project carefully, because most of our apps are based on that!
- Check out our [Knowledge base](/ios/knowledge-base.md) and read at least those articles marked with :star:.
- When in doubt, feel free to consult with your new colleagues! :hugs:

## Rules for Pull Requests
- Comments should be resolved by the person who wrote them (not by the author of the PR)
- PRs should be merged by the person who create them (not by the reviewer)
- Everybody is responsible to watch and react on PRs and comments they created
