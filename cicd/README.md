# Matee Wiki - CI/CD

## Basic info
- We are using CI/CD processes for all of our projects
- Depending on the project it is usually based either on the [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) or the [GitLab CI/CD](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/)
- Again, depending on the project, the processes can be executed either on cloud-based runners or self-hosted runners (on client's or Matee's servers)
- In case of self-hosted runners it can be useful to know some basics of [SSH](/tooling/ssh.md) and [VNC](/tooling/vnc.md)
