Once a month we have a breakfast together at our office. Everyone can bring something to eat and then we share.

## Multisport card :swimmer:
It is possible to order a multisportcard for you. The monthly fee for a person is 600CZK. You will pay 200CZK and Matee will pay 400CZK. When you send your monthly invoice to the company, increase the amount by 400CZK. After you recieve your monthly payment, you will recieve the Multisport card invoice for 600CZK.
